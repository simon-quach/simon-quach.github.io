        <h2 id="center">Description:</h2>
        <p id="center">The main objective of our game is to dodge all the incoming 
        fireballs coming from random directions. The player gains one point for 
        every second they are alive. The player can choose three modes in the main
        menu: Ease, Medium, and Hard. In easy, you have 5 lives, in medium, you 
        have 3 lives, and in hard, you have only 1 life.</p>
        <h2 id="center">Reflection:</h2>
        <p id="center">So my first intention was to make a pokemon game, but that
         seemed a bit too awkward with what we had to work with at the moment, so 
         I changed it to a fireball dodging game using Ash's character. I think the 
         randomizer was pretty successfull and also the fireballs. We had a lot of 
         trouble with the randomizer since we couldn't get the fireballs to appear 
         correctly but we finally got the operators to work. If we had more time,
          we would fix the bugs and make graphical adjustments.</p>
